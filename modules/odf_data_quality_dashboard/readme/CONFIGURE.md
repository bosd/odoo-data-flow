To configure this module, you need to assign users to the appropriate security groups. This module introduces two new groups to manage access:

*   **Data Quality User:** Users in this group can view, create, and edit data quality issues. They have read, write, and create permissions. This group is intended for functional users who are responsible for correcting data.

*   **Data Quality Manager:** Users in this group have full access to all data quality issues, including the ability to delete them. This group inherits all rights from the 'User' group and is intended for team leads or administrators.

To assign users to these groups, go to **Settings > Users & Companies > Users**, select a user, and under the 'Access Rights' tab, find the 'Data Quality' section to grant the desired permissions.
