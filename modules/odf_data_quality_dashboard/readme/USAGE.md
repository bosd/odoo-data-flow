Once installed, a 'Data Quality Dashboard' menu will appear under the 'Data Flow' top-level menu. This dashboard displays data quality issues in a Kanban view, categorized by their status (New, In Progress, Resolved).

Users can click on an issue to view its details, including a direct link to the problematic record (e.g., the Partner with an invalid VAT). From there, users can correct the data. Once the issue is fixed, the status of the quality issue record can be moved to 'Resolved'.
