This module provides a Data Quality Dashboard for Odoo. It helps improve data import workflows by decoupling data validation from the import process. Instead of blocking imports, it allows data to be imported quickly and then runs validation checks asynchronously. Issues found are logged as records in a 'Data Quality Issue' model, which are then displayed on a dashboard for users to review and resolve.
